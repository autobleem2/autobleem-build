"""Writes THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md at the repository root: every third-party component AutoBleem's programs
and packages carry, with its licence text verbatim - taken from the vendored copy where there is one,
so the file cannot drift from what is actually in the tree.

  python tools/make_third_party_notices.py

Run it after adding, removing or upgrading anything under lib_ableem/third_party, tests/third_party,
the fonts or the shipped libraries, and commit the result. The package scripts copy the file next to the
launcher (the MIT/BSD/zlib licences require their notices to travel with the binaries).
